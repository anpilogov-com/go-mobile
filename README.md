# Go Mobile
Test task for the organization of GO Mobile.

# Technological
Next, the technologies used in the project.

## HTML5
The project used the latest version 5 hypertext markup standard for 2021.

A semantic page layout was applied with adaptation for voiceover.

Synthetic tests were performed using Lighthouse and UX tests were performed  typical human.

## CSS3 (SCSS)
The cascading style preprocessor was used to speed up the description of styles for page objects. Do not judge strictly, this is my first project with the integration of the preprocessor for cascading styles.

Please note: IE may display some elements of the site incorrectly, since the page has not been adapted with polyphony expressions.

## JS + Gulp
The project uses the Gulp engine based on JS to speed up the development and compilation of style files, as well as to minimize the program code.

To install all the necessary components, the NPM was used.




If you have any suggestions on how to write code better, then do not hesitate to write them under this project.
